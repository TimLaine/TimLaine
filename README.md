### Hi I'm TimothÃ©e LainÃ©!

I used to be a linguist, then a professionnal writer, then I tried some things here and there and ended up back to one of my first love: programming. âš¡

I'm currently learning how to work as a web programmer at Elan Formation in Strasbourg (in France) and I'm looking for an internship to confirm my formation. These days, I'm learning PHP, HTML and CSS, and have a personnal interest in C#. âœ¨

I'm always open to opportunities, and would be happy to work in other countries than France, whether remotely or in person! ðŸ”­
